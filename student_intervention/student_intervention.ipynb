In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "    - Financial analysis: Use of CART for asserting the attractiveness of buy-writes.\n",
    "    - Manufacturing and Production: Decision trees have been recently used to non-destructively test welding quality, for semiconductor manufacturing, for increasing productivity, for material procurement method selection, etc..\n",
    "    - Medicine: Medical research and practice have long been important areas of application for decision tree techniques. - cular biology: Initiatives such as the Human Genome Project and the GenBank database offer fascinating opportunities for machine learning and other data exploration methods in molecular biology.\n",
    "    - Object recognition: Tree based classification has been used recently for recognizing three dimensional objects and for high level vision.\n",
    "    - Pharmacology: Use of tree based classification for drug analysis.\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "    - White box model, simple to understand and to interpret to visualise.\n",
    "    - Requires little data preparation.\n",
    "    - The cost of predicting data is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "    - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "    - Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Tend to go overfitting, needs stop conditions and pruning(not currently supported in sklearn)\n",
    "    - Sensitive to small variations\n",
    "    - Heuristic based algorithms such as the greedy algorithm cannot guarantee globally optimal. \n",
    "    - Hard to learn concepts containing such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems that decision tree is not good at\n",
    "    - Create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "    - All the cons can be mitigated by using ensemble methods (random forest).\n",

    "__Naive Bayes__\n",

    "__Support Vector Machines__\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "    - SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.\n",
    "    - Classification of images can also be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true of image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested Vapnik.\n",
    "    - Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM. \n",
    "    - The SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. Permutation tests based on SVM weights have been suggested as a mechanism for interpretation of SVM models. Support vector machine weights have also been used to interpret SVM models in the past. Posthoc interpretation of support vector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences.\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "    - Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    - Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "    - Memory efficient by using a subset of training points(support vectors) in kernels.\n",
    "    - Flexible kernels.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Not effetive if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples\n",
    "    - SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, can be mitigated by expensive five-fold cross-validation."

    "SVM is trying to find the decision boundary or hyperplane(usually N-1 dimention, if the data points are N dimention) that maximize the margin between different classes, please see the first graph below. \n",
    "- In training stage, SVM first finds the support vectors, data points nearest to the boundary between different classes, then, by choosing the boundary that has the most distances between the support vetors(called margin), SVM finally builds the model for the data points.\n",
    "- In prediction stage, SVM outputs the prediction based on which side one data point falls in. In the first graph, if the data point is in the right side of the hyperplane, SVM will predict it as the red class, otherwise the green one.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Kernels__. SVM could definitely find the decision boundary if the data points are linearly seperable. But if the data points are non-linear, or in another way, there is no linear boundary that could seperate the classes, then kernels are required(linear SVM use the linear kernel, one type of kernels). What non-linear kernels do is to lift the current dimension of data points into a higher one so that we could find a hyperplane to seperate the class. In the second graph, a 2D datapoint moves away from 2D to 3D, then a hyperplane is found to seperate the data points. In the third paragraph, the hyperplane is projected back to 2D, and the data points are seperated non-linearly."
