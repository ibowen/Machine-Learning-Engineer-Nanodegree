In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: ** SVM is trying to find the decision boundary that maximize the margin between different classes. If the classes are linearly seperable, SVM is natually going to find the boundary. In higher dimension, it involves finding the hyperplane (line in 2D, plane in 3D and hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best separates classes with the maximum margin. In practive, the model will first choose the subset of data points called support vectors that most relate to the boundary, and then it builds the maximum margin around the support vectors."
